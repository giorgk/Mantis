      MantisSA (Mantis for Salt; from the Greek Μάντισσα, meaning “female seer”) is a specialized variant of the high-performance Mantis modeling server, developed for the simulation of salt transport in groundwater systems. </br>
      Unlike the original Mantis framework, MantisSA explicitly accounts for the recirculation of salts through irrigation practices, incorporating the resulting salt feedback loop into the simulation workflow. </br>
      Due to the additional computational complexity introduced by this feedback mechanism, MantisSA is implemented as a multicore console application optimized for execution on High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters.
